	(a) \ For any ideal $I \subset R \times S$, we have the projection maps
	$\pi_R:R\times S \to R, \pi_S: \R \times S \to S$ where $\pi_R(r,s) = r$
	and $\pi_S(r,s) = s$. We have that $I$ is the intersection of the ideals $P
	= \pi_R(I) \times S$ and $Q = R \times \pi_S(I)$. It is clear that $R
	\times S = P + Q$ since $R \times \{0\} \subset Q$ and $\{0\} \times S
	\subset P$. Thus we can use the chinese remainder theorem.
	$$(R \times S)/I \cong (R \times S) / P \oplus (R \times S)/ Q$$
	We have that $(R \times S)/ P = (R \times S) / (\pi_R(I) \times S) \cong R
	/ \pi_R(I)$ and similarly $(R \times S)/Q \cong S/(\pi_S(I)$. Thus
	$$(R \times S)/I \cong R/\pi_R(I) \oplus S/\pi_S(I)$$
	Since $R, S$ are semi-simple, we know that the short exact sequences
	$$0 \to \pi_R(I) \to R \to R/(\pi_R(I)) \to 0$$
	$$0 \to \pi_S(I) \to S \to S/(\pi_S(I)) \to 0$$
	split, and we get
	$$R \cong R/(\pi_R(I)) \oplus \pi_R(I), S \cong  S/(\pi_S(I)) \oplus \pi_S(I)$$
	So
	$$R \times S \cong R/(\pi_R(I)) \oplus \pi_R(I) \times S/(\pi_S(I)) \oplus
	\pi_S(I)$$
	from our chinese remainder theorem identity:
	$$R \times S \cong (R \times S)/I \oplus \pi_R(I) \oplus \pi_S(I)$$
	And $I =  \pi_R(I) \oplus \pi_S(I)$ thus $R \times
	S$ is semi-simple.\\
	\\
	(b) \ If $a$ is square free, since a PID is a UFD we can factor $a$ as a
	produt of prime elements $a = p_1p_2 \dots p_n$. Thus from the chinese
	remainder theorem.
	$$R/(a) \cong R/(p_1) \oplus R/(p_2) \oplus \dots \oplus R/(p_n)$$
	each $R/(p_i)$ is a field (since the $p_i$s are irriducible elements) and
	thus simple. Thus $R/(a)$ is a direct sum of simple modules over $R$ and
	thus semi-simple.\\
	Conversly if $p^2 | a$ for some prime $p$ then the chinese remainder
	theorem results in
	$$R/(a) \cong R/(p^n) \oplus R/(b)$$
	where $p \not | \ b$ and $n \geq 2$. We have the ideal generated by $(p,0)$
	in $R/(p^n) \oplus R/(b)$ quotients to

	(a) \ We have the following isomorphism
	$$\C[\Z/n] \cong \C[x]/(x^n - 1]$$

	We have from the chinese remainder theorem 
	$$\C[x]/(x^n - 1) = \C[x]/\l(\prod_{m=0}^{n-1} (x - e^{\frac{2\pi im}{n}})
	\r) \cong \prod_{m=0}^{n-1} \C[x]/ (x - e^{\frac{2\pi im}{n}})$$
	Each $\C[x]/ (x - e^{\frac{2\pi im}{n}})$ is a free $\C$ module of rank 1
	and thus $\C[x]/ (x - e^{\frac{2\pi im}{n}}) \cong \C$. So we have 
	$$\C[\Z/n] \cong \prod_{m=0}^{n-1} \C$$

	$(iii) \Rightarrow (ii) \Rightarrow (i)$:\\
	From the identities we established leading up to the Artin Wedernburn
	theorem, we know that $R \cong \End_{R^{op}}(R^{op}) \cong M_{n}(D)$, where
	$M_n(D) \cong \End(M_1 \oplus M_2 \oplus \dots M_n)$. This comes from the
	identity $R^{op} \cong \oplus_{i=1}^n M_n$ where $M_n$ are simple modules.
	Since each $M_i$ is isomorphic to each other we only have $R$ is the direct
	sum of only one matrix ring over a division ring. Thus $(iii) \Rightarrow
	(ii)$. In problem 7.6(1) we have shown $M_n(D)$ is simple. $M_n(D)$ as an
	$R$ module is isomorphic to $D^n \oplus D^n \oplus \dots \oplus D^n$ which
	are simple $M_n(D)$ modules. Thus as we have established in lecture,
	$M_n(D)$ is Artinian since every every submodule is of the form $D^n \oplus
	D^n \oplus D^n \dots \oplus D^n$ and so a decsending chain must terminate
	on some number of $D^n$ as a direct sum.
	Thus $(ii) \Rightarrow (i)$.\\
	$(i) \Rightarrow (iii)$:\\
	$R$ contains a simple submodule $M$ as illustrated by the following
	process. If $R$ is simple, we are done, otherwise $R$ must contain some
	proper module $M_1$, either $M_1$ is simple or $M_1$ contains proper $M_2$.
	Continuing this logic yields a decsending chain of proper modules $R
	\supset M_1 \supset M_2 \dots$ since $R$ is Artinian there exists
	$M_n$ which terminates the chain, and thus must be simple.\\
	We know that Ann$_R(M)$ is a two sided ideal of $R$. Thus since $R$ is
	simple, we know Ann$_R(M) = 0$. We can now construct an isomorphism $\phi:R
	\to M^n$ for some $n$ and thus proving $R$ is semi-simple with every simple
	submodule of $R$ isomorphic to $M$. Since in lecture we established every
	simple $R$ module is a submodule of $R$, we have shown $(iii)$. We
	construct this isomorphism as follows:\\
	Let $\phi_0:R \to M$ where $1 \to m_0$ for some $m_0 \in M$. Either $\ker
	\phi_0 = 0$ or $\exists r_0 \in \ker \phi_0$. Since Ann$_R(M)= 0$ there
	exists $m_1 \in M$ such that $r_1m_1 \neq 0$. We define the new homorphism
	$\phi_1:R \to M^2$ where $1 \to (m_0, m_1)$ thus $r_1 \notin \ker \phi_1$
	since $\phi_1(r_1) = (r_1m_0,r_1m_1) \neq (0,0)$, either $\ker \phi_2 = 0$ or
	there exists $r_2 \in \ker \phi_1$ and $m_2 \in M$ with $r_2m_2 \neq 0$.
	Thus we can define $\phi_2 : R \to M^3$ where $1 \to (m_0,m_1,m_2)$ and
	thus $r_2 \notin \ker \phi_2$. Continuing this process we get a decsending
	chain of submodules of $R$
	$$\ker \phi_0 \supset \ker \phi_1 \supset \ker \phi_2 \supset \dots $$
	Thus since $R$ is Artinian this chain terminates, which means there exists
	$\phi_k = \phi:R \to M^n$ with $\ker \phi = 0$. So $\phi$ is an imbedding
	into $M^n$. Thus $R$ is a submodule of $M^n$ and thus $R \cong M^k$ for
	some $k \leq n$.

	(a) \ Letting $A(t) = \sum_{i \geq 0} h_it$ and $B(t) =  \sum_{i \geq 0}
	e_it$, we can using combinatorial reasoning to write these series in a new
	form.\\
	When we multiply out 
	$$\prod_{i = 1}^n (1 + x_it) = (1 + x_1t)(1 + x_2t) \dots (1 + x_nt) $$
	We get $B(t)$. The reasoning for this is because for each $k$, a $t^k$ only
	shows up in the product by choosing $k$ $x_it$ terms and multiplying by $1$
	for the other terms. Thus every $t^k$ term is of the form $x_{j_1}x_{j_2}
	\dots x_{j_k}$ where $1\leq j_1 < j_2 < \dots j_n \leq n$, and conversly
	all $x_{j_1}x_{j_2} \dots x_{j_k}$ show up uniquely as a coefficient of one
	of the $t^k$ terms by choosing $x_{j_1}x_{j_2} \dots x_{j_k}$ and
	multiplying out by $1$ for the other terms. Summing up all these terms we
	get the symmetric polynomials:
	$$\sum_{1 \leq j_1 < j_2 < \dots j_k \leq n} x_{j_1} \dots x_{j_k}t^k = e_kt^k$$
	Thus $B(t) = \prod_{i = 1}^n (1 + x_it)$ since each coefficient of $t^k$ is
	the same in both polynomials.\\
	For $A(t)$ we have the following product of the closed form of the
	geometric series
	$$\prod_{i = 1}^n \frac1{ 1 - x_it } = \prod_{i = 1}^n\l(1 + x_it +
	(x_it)^2 + (x_it)^3 \dots + (x_it)^k \dots \r)$$
	When we factor out this product we get $A(t)$. The reasoning for this is
	because for each $k$, a $t^k$ only shows up in the product if we choose
	$(x_{j_1}t)^{n_1}, (x_{j_2}t)^{n_2}, \dots (x_{j_l}t)^{n_l}$ so that $n_1 +
	n_2 \dots n_l = k$ and multiply by the $1$ term for every other
	term in the product. Thus every $t^k$ term is one of the terms in $h_k$. We
	have that every term of $h_k$ shows up uniquely as a coefficient of one of
	the $t^k$ since any monomial $x_{j_1}^{n_1}x_{j_2}^{n_2}\dots
	x_{j_l}^{n_l}$ of total degree $k$ shows up only by choosing the terms
	$(x_{j_1}t)^{n_1}(x_{j_2}t)^{n_2}\dots (x_{j_l}t)^{n_l}$ and $1$s in the
	other terms. Thus when we sum up all the $t^k$ terms we get $h_kt^k$.\\
	\\
	(b) \ From our product identities we have the equality
	$$A(t)B(-t) = \prod_{i = 1}^n (1 - x_it)\prod_{i = 1}^n \frac1{ 1 - x_it } = 1$$
	By factoring out $A(t)B(-t)$ we get the constant term $e_0h_0 = 1$, thus
	subtracting the constant term on both sides we get the sum of nonconstant
	terms is $0$. Thus for each $k \geq 1$ the coefficient of $t^k$ is zero. We
	have that every $t^k$ coefficient term is of the form
	$h_n(-1)^me_m$ where $m + n = k$.  Thus the sum of the coefficients of the
	$t^k$ terms is $h_k - h_{k-1}e_1 + h_{k-2}e_2 - \dots + (-1)^ke_k$. This
	coefficient must be zero, thus we have Newtons identity
	$$h_k - h_{k-1}e_1 + h_{k-2}e_2 - \dots + (-1)^ke_k = 0$$
	(c) \ From Newtons identity we can that $\Lambda_n =
	\Z[h_1, \dots h_n]$. We from lecture that $\Lambda_n = \Z[e_1, \dots
	e_n]$ thus if we show $\Z[h_1, \dots h_n] = \Z[e_1 , \dots e_n]$ we are done.
	By showing that $h_1, \dots h_n$ linearly spans $e_1 \dots e_n$ we are done
	(we already know $e_1, e_2 \dots e_n$ spans $h_1 \dots h_n$ since $e_1,
	\dots e_n$ generate all symmetric polynomials). Using induction we have the
	base case $h_0 = e_0$. From Newtons identity:
	$$(-1)^{k-1}(h_k - h_{k-1}e_1 + h_{k-2}e_2 - \dots e_{k-1}h_1) = e_k$$
	We have that each $e_k$ is a linear sum of $e_i$ and $h_j$ where $i < k$
	thus from our inductive hypothesis each $e_i$ is a linear sum of
	$h_j$s and thus $e_k$ is a linear sum of $h_j$s.
