		\begin{enumerate}
			\item
				We know that $42$ must divide $32|H|$ since
				$|H|$ is the order of $32$ and adding $32$ $H$
				is the same as multiplying $32$ by $H$,
				therefore
				$$|H| = \frac{LCM(32,48)}{32} = \frac{32 * 3 *
				7}{32} = 21$$
				And by Lagrange's thm we have 
				$$|H||G:H| = |G| = 48$$
				so $|G:H| = 2$
			\item
				Using the same logic above we have
				$$|H| = \frac{LCM(24, 54)}{24} = \frac{24 * 3 *
				3}{24} = 9$$
				and so
				$$|G:H| = \frac{|G|}{|H|} = \frac{54}{9} = 6$$
			\item
				Using the same logic:
				$$|H| = \frac{LCM(100,112)}{100} = \frac{2 * 2
				* 7 * 100}{100} = 28$$
				So 
				$$|G:H| = \frac{|G|}{|H|} = \frac{112}{28} = 4$$
		\end{enumerate}

\begin{ques}
	\textbf{10.5}
		Given any element $a \in G$, by Lagrange's thm we have $|\langle
		a \rangle|$ divides $|G| = 8$. Since $G$ is not cyclic we know
		$\langle a \rangle \neq G$ so $|\langle a \rangle| \neq 8$.
		Therefore the only options for $|\langle a \rangle|$ are $1, 2,
		4$. Since all these numbers divide $4$, we know that $a^4 = e$

\end{ques}

\begin{ques}
	\textbf{10.6}
		We know that the intersection of two subgroups is a group.
		Therefore if we let $A = H \cap K$, we have that $A$ is a
		subgroup of both $H$ and $K$ so by Lagrange's thm we have that
		$|A|$ divides both $|H| = 12$ and $|K| = 5$. The only number
		that divides both $12$ annd $5$ is $1$, so $|A| = 1$ so $A =
		\{e\}$

\end{ques}

\begin{ques}
	\textbf{10.14}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item
				This is because we know for the element $x$ of order $6$,
				$|\langle x \rangle| = 6 = |G|$ and a subgroup
				of $G$ that is the same size of $G$ is
				equivalent to $G$. Therefore $G = \langle x
				\rangle$ is cyclic
			\item
				By Lagrange's thm for any element $a \in G$,
				$|\langle a \rangle|$ divides $|G| = 6$
				$|\langle a \rangle|$ cannot equal $6$ since
				$G$ is not cyclic, so $a$ must have either
				order 1, 2, or 3. We know that only $e$ has
				order $1$. We cannot have all the elements have
				order $2$, otherwise we would have two elements
				$a$, $b$, then we would have $ab$, each having
				order $2$ so they are their own inverses. So we
				have $\{e, a, b, ab\}$ which is closed with size $4$,
				so we must introduce another element $c$, which
				would bring us to $\{e, a, b, c, ab, ac, bc,
				abc\}$ which is too large. Therefore there is
				some element $a$ of order $3$
			\item
				If we take some element $b \in G: b \notin
				\langle a \rangle$, we already know $e, a, a^2
				\in G$. We know since $b \notin
				\langle a \rangle$ that $ab, a^2b \notin
				\langle a \rangle$ since $b$ is not equal to any
				power of $a$. Looking at $ab$, we can deduce
				$ab \neq a^2b$, since applying $b^{-1}$ on the
				right yields $a \neq a^2$ which is true. Therefore we have
				$$\{e, a, a^2, b, ab, a^2b\} \subseteq G$$
				Are all unique elements
			\item 
				We cannot have $b^2$ be a seperate element in
				the above set since $|G| = 6$, if $b^2 = a$
				then $b = a^2$ which is not true, if $b^2 a^2$
				then $b = a$ which is not true, if $b^2 = ab$
				then applying $b^{-1}$ on the right yields $b =
				a$ which is not true, and finally if $b^2 =
				a^2b$ then $b = a^2$ which is not true.
				Therefore $b^2 = e$.
			\item
				We have $(ba)^{-1} = a^{-1}b^{-1} = a^2b$ but
				since we concluded $a^2b$ has order 2
				$(a^2b)^{-1} = a^2b = ba$. Similarly
				$(ba^2)^{-1} = ab = (ab)^{-1}$
		\end{enumerate}
\end{ques}

\begin{ques}
	\textbf{10.15}
		By Lagrange's thm we have $|G| = |G:H||H|$ and $|H| = |H:K||K|$
		so $|K| = \frac{|H|}{|H:K|}$. We also have
		$$|G:K|= \frac{|G|}{|K|}$$
		Substituting the equalities for $|G|$ and $|K|$ yields
		$$|G:K| = \frac{|H:K||G:H||H|}{|H|} = |G:H||H:K|$$
\end{ques}

\begin{ques}
	\textbf{10.16}
		Because $|G|$ is odd we know the order of none of the elements
		except for the identity can be $2$.\\
		If the order of some element $a \in G$ was $2$ then $|\langle a
		\rangle| = 2$ but by Lagrange's thm $|\langle a \rangle|$
		should divide $|G|$ which cannot happen since $|G|$ is odd.\\
		Therefore for all elements $a \in G$, we know $a^{-1} \neq a$\\
		Therefore if we take the product of all the elements in $G$, we
		know that for every element in that product, it's inverse is
		present in that product as well. Since $G$ is abelian we can
		rearrange the product so that each element and it's inverse
		present in the product cancel out, to be left with $e$
