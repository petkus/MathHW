	It does follow. For any Cauchy sequence $(a_n)_n$ with the limit $a$ (if it
	exists), we have that the set $S = (a_n)_n \cup \{a\}$ is closed and
	bounded (We know that every Cauchy sequence is bounded). From our midterm
	problem we know that any subsequence of $(a_n)_n$ converges to $a$.
	Therefore in order for $S$ to be compact, $a$ must exist in $S$ and so
	exists in $M$
\end{ques}

\begin{ques}{23}
	We know that $(0,1)$ is open in $\R$ as proven in class. For any $r$, we
	have that $(0,r/2) \in B_r(0,0)$ but $(0,r/2) \notin (0,1) \times \{0\}$
	therefore $B_r(0,0) \not \subseteq (0,1) \times \{0\}$. Therefore $(0,1)
	\times \{0\}$ is not open.

\begin{ques}{28}
	(a) \ Not necessarily. Consider the map from the unit circle $f : S^1 \to
	[0, 2\pi)$ where $f(\c(\t), \s(\t)) = \t$. We have that the inverse image
	of the open set $[0,\epsilon)$ is the closed set $\{(\c(\t),\s(\t)): \t \in
	[0, \epsilon)\}$\\
	(b) \ Yes. Since $f$ has a continous inverse mapping $f^{-1}$ for any open
	set $U \subseteq M$ we have that the pullback of $f^{-1}$ of an open set is
	open. Thus $f(U) = (f^{-1})^{-1}(U)$ is open.\\
	(c) \ Yes. Since $f$ is bijective it has an inverse $f^{-1}$. For any open
	set $U$, the pullback of $f^{-1}$ of $U$ is just $f(U)$ which is open. Thus
	$f^{-1}$ is continous. So $f$ is a homeomorphism. \\
	(d) \ Not necessarily. Consider the map  $f :\R^2 \to [0, 2\pi)$ where
	$f(\c(\t), \s(\t)) = \t$. This is the inverse map as the example used in
	(a). Thus it is bijective, specifically surjective. However the same open
	set in the example does not map to an open set

	For any point $p \in \N$ we have that for $r = 1$, by definition the set
	$B_r(p) = \{p\}$ is open.\\
	Therefore singletone points are open in $\N$, so any set $S \subseteq \N$
	is open since
	$$S = \bigcup_{s \in S} \{s\}$$
	And we know arbitrary unions of open sets are open. Therefore we have that
	$S^{c}$ is open as well. The complement of an open set is closed so we know
	that $S$ is closed as well. Therefore every set $S \subseteq \N$ is clopen.\\
	This means that every function $f: \N \to M$ is continous since the inverse
	image of any open set $U \subseteq M$ will be open.
\end{ques}

\begin{ques}{34}
	For any closed set $L \subset N$ with $N$ closed from the inheritance
	principle we know $L = C \cap N$ for some closed set $C \subset M$.
	Intersections of closed sets are closed. Thus $L$ is closed in $M$.
	Similarly if $U \subset N$ is open and $N$ is open,  then from the
	inheritance principle $U = V \cap N$ where $V$ is open in $M$. Finite
	intersections of open sets are open, thus $U$ is open in $M$.

	For $d_E$:  \\
	We have that $d_E(p,p') = \sqrt{\langle p, p' \rangle}$ with the inner
	product $\langle p , p'\rangle = d_X(x,x')^2 + d_Y(y,y')^2$ 
	For $d_\text{max}$:\\
	We have that $d_\text{max}(p,p') = \sqrt{\langle p, p' \rangle}$ with the inner
	product $\langle p , p'\rangle = $ 
	For $d_\text{sum}$:\\
	We have that $d_\text{sum}(p,p') = \sqrt{\langle p, p' \rangle}$ with the inner
	product $\langle p , p'\rangle = $
