	\textbf{17.20}
	If $aR = R$ then since $1 \in R$ there must be $1 \in aR$ which means
	there must be some $a^{-1}$ such that $aa^{-1} =1$ which means $a$ is a
	unit. For implication in the other direction, we have for any $x \in
	R$, assuming $a$ is a unit with multiplicative inverse $a^{-1}$, we
	have $a^{-1}x \in R$ and $a (a^{-1}x) = x \in aR$. Therefore every element of
	$R$ is an element of $aR$ and so $R \subseteq aR$, and since $R$ is
	closed under multiplication, for any $x \in R$, $ax \in R$, so $aR
	\subseteq R$ and so it follows 
	$$R = aR$$
\end{ques}

\begin{ques}
	\textbf{A}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item
		We have
		$$a^2 = a \Rightarrow a^2 - a = 0 \Rightarrow a(a - 1) = 0$$
		Since $R$ is an integral domain, $a(a-1) = 0$ if and only if
		either $a$ or $a-1$ is zero, and since the additive inverse is
		unique, that means $a$ is either $1$ or $0$.
		\item
		The idempotents are $1$, $5$, and $6$.
		\item
		For any $(a,b) \in
		\mathbb Z \times \mathbb Z$ we have 
		$$(a, b)(a, b) = (a, b) \Rightarrow (a^2 - a, b^2 - b) = (0,0)
		\Rightarrow a^2 - a =0, b^2 - b = 0$$
		And since $\mathbb Z$ is an integral domain, that means $a,b
		\in \{0, 1\}$ and so the idempotents are $(0,0), (1,1), (1,0),
		(0,1)$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{ques}

\begin{ques}
	\textbf{B}
	We can deduce the set of idempotents in $S$ is a subset of
	the idempotents in $R$ since $s \in S \Rightarrow s \in R$ and the
	conditions in either set is the same: $s^2 = s$.\\
	As shown in problem Aa, the only idempotents in $R$ are $1_R$ and $0_R$\\
	Subrings of an integral domain is an integral domain as well so $S$
	also has the property that the idempotents in $S$ are $1_S$ and $0_R$.
	Therefore we have.
	$$\{0_S, 1_S\} \subseteq \{0_R, 1_R\}$$
	From basic group theory we know the identity of a subgroup is equal to
	the identity of the containing group. Therefore $0_S = 0_R$ since $0$
	is the identity of the groups $R, S$ over additition. So we have $1_S
	\neq 0_S \Rightarrow 1_S \neq 0_R$. The only other element in $\{0_R,
	0_S\}$ that $1_S$ can be is $1_R$

	True:\\
	Consider the subring
	$$S = 5\mathbb Z _{25} = \{0, 5, 10, 15, 20\}$$
	This is a subring since we have $x|5 \Leftrightarrow x \in S$ and for
	any $a, b \in S$, $ab | 5$ so $ab \in S$. We also have $a + b |5$ so $a
	+b \in S$. Thererfore $S$ is closed under addition and multiplication
	and is finite, so it is a subring. $S$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb Z _5$,
	let $\varphi: S \to \mathbb Z_5$ with $\varphi(5x) = x$. We have
	$$\varphi(5x)\varphi(5y) = xy = \varphi(5xy)$$
	and
	$$\varphi(5x) + \varphi(5y) = x + y = \varphi(5(x + y))$$
	So $\varphi$ is a homomorphism. We have $\varphi(0) = 0, \varphi(5) =
	1, \varphi(10) = 2, \varphi(15) = 3, \varphi(20) = 4$, and so $\varphi$
	is a bijections so an isomorphism.
