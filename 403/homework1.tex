\begin{ques}
	\textbf{16.1}
	This is a special case of thm 16.1 ii:\\
	We have 
	$$(-1)a + a = (-1 + 1)a = 0 \cdot a = 0$$
	and so subtracting $a$ on both sides yields 
	$$(-1)a = -a$$
\end{ques}

\begin{ques}
	\textbf{16.7}
	Since $F$ is a field we know there is $a^{-1} \in F$ such that
	$aa^{-1} = 1$. Therefore if we let $x = a^{-1}(-b)$ we satisfy the equation:
	$$a(a^{-1}(-b)) + b = (aa^{-1})(-b) + b = -b + b = 0$$
	We get that first equality since $\cdot$ is associative
\end{ques}

\begin{ques}
	\textbf{16.11}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item
			The only unit is $(1,1)$ since for any $a,b \in
			\mathbb Z$, $ab = 1 \Leftrightarrow a=1, b=1$.
			The only zero-divisor is $(0,0)$ since for any
			$a,b \in \mathbb Z$, $ab = 0 \Leftrightarrow
			a=0$ and/or $b = 0$. Since the set of nilpotents
			elements is a subset of zero-divisors, it
			follows that the only nilpotent is also $(0,0)$.
		\item
			From previous knowledge of groups we know every
			element in $\mathbb Z_3$ has an inverse under
			the group operation of multiplication modulo
			$3$, therefore we know for any $(a,b) \in
			\mathbb Z_3 \oplus \mathbb Z_3$ there is a
			$(a^{-1}, b^{-1}) \in \mathbb Z_3 \oplus
			\mathbb Z_3$ such that $(a,b)(a^{-1},b^{-1}) =
			(1,1)$ and so every element in $\mathbb Z_3
			\oplus \mathbb Z_3$ is a unit. Since $3$ is
			prime there is no two numbers that can multiply
			together to be a multiple of $3$ unless one of
			the two numbers is already a multiple of $3$,
			only $(0,0)$ is a zero-divisor and
			from that it follows (since the set of
			nilpotents is a subset of zero-divisors) that
			$(0,0)$ is the only nilpotent
		\item
			The units are $(1,1), (1,5), (3,1), (3,5)$ with
			respective inverses $(1,1), (1,5), (3,1),
			(3,5)$. The zero-divisors are all the rest of
			the elements: $(0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (2,2),
			(2,3), (2,4)$. The nilpotents are $(0,0),
			(2,0)$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{ques}

\begin{ques}
	\textbf{16.13}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item
			If there were two multiplicative identities: $1
			\neq 1'$ we would have by definition of the
			multiplicative identity
			$$1 = 1\cdot1' = 1'$$
			and so $1 = 1'$
		\item
			If there were two multiplicative inverses, let
			$\beta$ and $\alpha$ be multiplicative
			inverses of $a$. We have
			$$\beta = \beta(a \alpha) = (\beta a)\alpha =
			\alpha$$
			And so $\beta = \alpha$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{ques}

\begin{ques}
	\textbf{A}
	From the definition we know that the center is abelian and from
	the definition of a division ring we know every element is a
	unit. Now all we need to show is that the center is closed
	under multiplication and addition. Given any $a, b \in $ the
	center of $R$ we have for any $x \in R$
	$$(a + b)x = ax + bx = xa + xb = x(a + b)$$ 
	and so $a + b$ is in the center. We also have
	$$(ab)x = axb = x(ab)$$
	and so $ab$ is in the center. Therefore the center is a field.
\end{ques}

\begin{ques}
	\textbf{B}
	$\mathbb Z \times \mathbb Z$ is not an integral domain.
	Consider any $a, b \in \mathbb Z / \{0\}$
	$$(a, 0) \cdot (0, b) = (0,0)$$
	and so $(a,0)$ and $(0,b)$ are non-zero zero-divisors.
\end{ques}

\begin{ques}
	\textbf{C}
	$\mathbb Z_{10}$ is not an integral domain. Consider
	$$2 \cdot 5 = 0$$
	and so $2$ and $5$ are non-zero zero-divisors. Observing that
	$S$ is the set of all even integers in $R$ we know that $S$ is
	closed under addition and multiplication since multiplying or
	adding to even numbers yields an even number. Addition is still
	commutative in $S$. Therefore $S$ is a subring of $R$. \\
	$S$ is an integral domain since for any $s \in S$ in order for
	$s \cdot a = 0$, $10$ must divide $sa$ and so $2 \cdot 5$ must
	divide $sa$. However since $s$ is even if it also has a factor
	of $5$ then it is a multiple of $10$ since it has a factor of
	both $5$ and $2$. If $s \neq 0$ mod $10$ then, $a$ must have a
	factor of $5$ and so if $a \in S$ then $a$ is $0$ since $a$
	would have a factor of $5$ and a factor of $2$. Therefore there
	is no non-zero term $a \in S$ such that $sa = 0$.\\
	$S$ is a field since $S$ is commutative (since $R$ is
	commutative) and each term is a unit with $6$ the
	multiplicative identity: $2 \cdot 8 = 6$, $4 \cdot 4 = 6$, $6
	\cdot 6 = 6$, $6 \cdot 2 = 2$, $6 \cdot 4 = 4$, and $6 \cdot 8
	= 8$.
\end{ques}

\begin{ques}
	\textbf{D}
	We in order for $\left[\begin{array}{cc} a & b \\ c & d
	\end{array}\right]$ to be in the center we have for any $w,x,y,z
	\in \mathbb R$:
	$$\left[\begin{array}{cc} a & b \\ c &
	d \end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{cc} w &
	x \\ y & z \end{array}\right] =
	\left[\begin{array}{cc} w & x \\ y & z
	\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{cc}
	a & b \\ c & d \end{array}\right]$$
	$$= \left[\begin{array}{cc} aw + by & ax + bz
	\\ cw + dy & cx + dz \end{array}\right] =
	\left[\begin{array}{cc} wa + xc & wb + xd
	\\ ya + zc & yb + zd \end{array}\right] $$
	Equating the top left and bottom right corners gives us $by =
	cx$. The only way for those quantities be equal for any $x,y$ is if
	$b= c= 0$. From there, equating the top right and bottom left
	corners gives us $ax = xd$ and $dy = ya$. Dividing by $x$ for
	the first equation or $y$ for the second equation yields $a =
	d$. Therefore the center consisits of all matricies of the form
	$$\left[ \begin{array}{cc} a & 0 \\ 0 & a \end{array} \right]$$
	With $a \in \mathbb R$
\end{ques}

\begin{ques}
	\textbf{E}
	We already know the addition operation is commutative and the
	operations have the distributive property, so we just have
	to show $S$ is closed under addition and multiplication.\\
	For any 
	$$A = \left[\begin{array}{cc} a & b \\ -b & a \end{array}\right], B =
	\left[\begin{array}{cc} c & d\\ -d & c \end{array}\right] \in S$$
	$$A + B = \left[\begin{array}{cc} a + c & b + d\\ -(b + d) & a + c
	\end{array}\right] \in S$$
	$$AB = \left[\begin{array}{cc} ac - bd & ad + bc\\ -(ad + bc) & -bd + ac
	\end{array}\right] \in S$$
	Therefore $S$ is a subring of $M_2(\mathbb R)$. To show $S \cong
	\mathbb C$ we define the bijection $\varphi:$ 
	$$\varphi \left(\left[\begin{array}{cc} a & b\\ -b &
	a\end{array}\right]\right) = a + bi$$
	To show that its a homomorphism we have using the multiplaction
	equalities above
	$$\varphi(A)\varphi(B) = (a + ib)(c + id) = ac - bd + (ad + bc)i = \varphi(AB)$$
	As well as
	$$\varphi(A) + \varphi(B) = a + ib + c + id = (a + c) + (b + d)i =
	\varphi(A + B)$$
	And finally we know that $\varphi$ is bijective since for any $a + ib
	\in \mathbb C$ the matrix $\left[\begin{array}{cc} a & b \\ -b & a
	\end{array}\right]$ will map to that number, and if any two matricies
	map to the same number then the two numbers that determine their
	entries must be the same so they must be the same matrix
